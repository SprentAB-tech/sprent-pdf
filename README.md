# Idea: Using a third party as a backoffice

Airtable can be talked to via an OpenAPI: https://github.com/TheF1rstPancake/AirtableOpenAPICustomBlock

Notion doesn't have this, but has great functionality: https://www.notion.so/b8a77a6b1ae144be992b6c59c2acbb3f?v=5eeb4cd3370f49fe9c9a00c5d1bb5c4c . If we'd have the same for notion (or just use Airtable) we can connect anything to notion and create our own frontend even!

The frontend would just be a thin layer with a "Sign In to Notion" loginwall in front. The frontend, however, not be the backoffice itself. This would be notion. However, it would allow to have API-coupled actions to fill datapoints, and allow for tools such as PDF creation.

TODO:

1. âœ… Convert all sprent data into CSVs or JSON (use Claude and Schema.md)

2. âœ… Import CSVs/JSON into the tables, either using CSV import (if it works) or through the API

3. âœ… Make a simple React + Vite + Vercel project (https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/vite)

4. âœ… Add form prefilled with ?id=, to submit an ID and fetch the housing object, setting ?id=xxx as well

5. âœ… Deploy this at https://pdf.sprent.com with a secret admin password in front (later to be replaced with notion OAuth2)

6. âœ… Create an access_token for Notion for sprent: https://developers.notion.com / https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations

7. âœ… Use https://www.actionschema.com/reference.html?openapiUrl=https://openapi.actionschema.com/notion.json#/operations/queryDatabase to retrieve the entire housing object.

8. âœ… Validate the media uploaded to Notion are accessible for us on the outside.

9. âœ… Validate the relations are accessible.

10. âœ… Validate that I can update a Media URL and also a Relation UUID based on an ID found. Use https://developers.notion.com/reference/patch-page

# Make PDF Renderer

ðŸš« Create Notion OpenAPI so I have an SDK for projects + housings + companies + people

- For prod
- For staging

Pull in the PDF renderer into the React app, making it standalone functional for the pulled-in housing object. Here, fix the images shown so they show nicely.
